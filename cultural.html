    <h3> PURPOSE </h3>
    <p> This self-portrait reflects the mix of my two cultures: Thai and American. The bow represents me, a bond tying my two ethnicities together. The English words are translated into Thai, making it known that I proudly identify as being both American and Thai. </p>

    <h3> PURPOSE </h3>
    <p> Nowadays, talking to someone online is the norm. However, some people get used and we need to be careful in those situations. The PSEUDO team understands this problem and focuses the game around chatting with a fictional character to figure out how a predator may approach you</p>
