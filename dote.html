    <h3> WHAT IS IT? </h3>
    <p> Dote is a shopping and influencer app meant for you to shop and gain rewards from all the stores inside of it. However, it has been underfire due to its lack of inclusivity.</p>

      <h3> WHY I DID IT? </h3>
      <p>- Dote made it fun for me to shop there. Iâ€™m a very cheap person, so when it came down to deals, I was always there for it.</p>
      <p>- I would be getting clothes that was $100 for only $2 </p>
      <p>- Though great for me, I knew that they were probably losing money & I thought they had a great idea, but were progressing it in the wrong way </p>
