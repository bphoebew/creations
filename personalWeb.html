    <h3> INSPIRATION </h3>
    <p> I found some cartoon drawings that I made on Adobe Illustrator a white ago and I did not want the drawings to go to waste. I used those ones and created some more to create a desktop.</p>

      <h3> FUN FACTS </h3>
      <p>On a computer, the website will look like a desktop. On a phone, the website will look like an iphone format</p>
      <p> All the folders and tabs opened on the desktop are meant to be moved around </p>
      <p> When you change the colors of my websites, they will always stay the same to the way you customized it </p>
