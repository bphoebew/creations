    <h2 class = "title"> Personal Website </h2>
    <!-- <p> My personal website started out as a fun <br>coding project that I wanted to do a few <br>weeks after I went through Kode With <br>Klossy, an all girls' camp. </p> -->
    <p>I wanted to make my own personal website <br>explaining myself. What is wrong with that?</p>
    <h3> ROLE </h3>
    <p> Creator </p>
    <p> Designer </p>
    <p> Owner </p>
    <h3> INSPIRATION </h3>
    <p> I found some cartoon drawings that I<br> made on Adobe Illustrator a white ago<br> and I did not want the drawings to go<br> to waste. I used those ones and <br>created some more to create a desktop.</p>
    <h3> Fun Facts </h3>
    <p> On a computer, the website will <br>look like a desktop. On a phone, <br>the website will look like <br>an iphone format</p>
    <p> All the folders and tabs opened <br>on the desktop are meant <br>to be moved around </p>
    <p> When you change the colors of my <br> websites, they will always stay <br>the same to the way you <br>customized it </p>
