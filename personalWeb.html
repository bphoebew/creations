    <!-- <p> My personal website started out as a fun <br>coding project that I wanted to do a few <br>weeks after I went through Kode With <br>Klossy, an all girls' camp. </p> -->
    <p>I wanted to make my own personal website <br>explaining myself. What is wrong with that?</p>
    <h3> ROLE </h3>
    <p> Creator </p>
    <p> Designer </p>
    <p> Owner </p>
    <h3> INSPIRATION </h3>
    <p> I found some cartoon drawings that I<br> made on Adobe Illustrator a white ago<br> and I did not want the drawings to go<br> to waste. I used those ones and <br>created some more to create a desktop.</p>
